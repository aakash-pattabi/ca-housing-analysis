    "We'll also add one more check to the callback function above. Namely, for some Tracts (where the population is very small), the intercensal estimates are sufficiently poor that the Census reports no data. As we calculate the Gini score for these Tracts, we'll simply assign a placeholder of -1. Then, we'll post-process the data and assign these Tracts the median Gini score in the reported data so they don't affect the resulting distribution. This is somewhat ad-hoc, but is accepted practice where data is missing. "
